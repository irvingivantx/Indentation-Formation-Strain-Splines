Strain in dents may be estimated using data from ILI tools or from direct measurement of dent deformation contours (API 1183). This project consists of testing relationship between the penalized sum of squares smoothing objective of the fitted spline versus calculated dent strain. Interpolation or other mathematical techniques may be used to develop surface contour information but this project focuses on natural cubic splines.
